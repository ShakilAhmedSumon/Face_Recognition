# Face_Recognition
Face Recognition Using FaceNet and SVM

Make folders by the name of the person inside the train folder which will be found in the data directory. Put three or four pictures 
of the person inside it. Make at least two folders in the train directory. 

Give an image to the model to predict. Run this command:

             python3 face_recognition.py random.jpg
 
random.jpg is the directory of the image to be detected.

The images can not contain multiple faces on them. 
I assume that you have kears and sklearn installed in your system.
